### Hi there, I am Semyon

I am a student from Russia, into programming, design and some other things. I mainly make desktop applications in C#, can mention an unofficial desktop client for the Yandex Music service (it's like a spotify) which I am developing on AvaloniaUI. Also recently started learning python, for possible university studies in the future. I don't mind code together, there is a link to telegram on [my website](http://kotof.me).
